## Project Motivation

For this project, we are interestested in using residential homes in Ames, Iowa data to better understand:

1. What story can we tell from our target variable SalePrice?
2. What features do people care about most when they buy aÂ house?
3. How accurately can we perform on predicting the houses sale prices?

## File Descriptions

The text file `data_description.txt` contains full descriptions of each column.

The csv file `train.csv` and `test.csv` are the datasets we use for this project.

The `UdacityProjectBlogPost_HousePrices.ipynb` file is the notebook of detailed analysis.
